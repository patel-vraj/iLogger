# iLogger
iLogger program allows user to store their login credentials in an encrypted file with 128 AES encryption key and the user's created master password. 
A Python-based program with a command-line interface allows users to enter their website logins, a custom label for those dates. It securely saves that information in the encrypted formatted JSON file. Users can review, edit, or remove their login entries anytime with their master password. Users can't be able to access key and master password files, and it secures hides from the user's interface for preventing user's privacy. 
To run “iLogger.py" it requires following ibraries:
• pip install --upgrade pip
• pip install cryptography
